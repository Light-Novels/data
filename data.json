After receiving an invitation from the Academy's director, Greyworth Ciel Mais to come to Areisha Spirit Academy, he loses his way in the spirit forest and stumbles upon a girl named Claire Rouge purifying herself in a lake.

In order to save her life and much to Claire's chagrin, Kamito forms a contract with the sword spirit himself, turning him into the only male elementalist in the world (he also becomes the second male elementalist in 1000 years). Disregarding the fact that he saved her life, she accuses him of stealing her spirit and insists that he atone for it by becoming her contracted spirit.</p>",

After enjoying a nice, long life of 94 years, he was looking forward to shutting his eyes for the last time. He was, therefore, understandably upset when he woke up again in an empty space, devoid of memories, with a young girl in a tunic rambling on and on about how she's God. So, he did what any reasonable person would have done under those circumstances: he sent the girl flying with a kick to the face. It turned out that the girl was indeed God, and she was in a pinch. She urgently needed someone to do some interdimensional Resource smuggling, and Renya fit the bill. His mission: cross the boundary into another world, then chill for a few decades. God would handle the rest. To sweeten the deal, she offered him an eighteen-year-old body and a whole laundry list of ludicrously powerful skills, yet he remained hesitant. Then, she mentioned the food — an exotic world comes with exotic delicacies — and this sealed the deal. The next thing he knew, he was standing in a foreign land, younger, stronger, and more clueless than ever. Will he survive this world? And more importantly, will the world survive him?</p>",

Bit hard to chill when you’ve got a king in your face telling you there’s a bad guy you’ve gotta go slay or whatever, you know? Plot twist, though—it’s actually not so bad. Getting the hero treatment sounds pretty nice, right? But then it happens again! Some other clown summons me, I get my obligatory superpower, and off I go. And sure, that’s fine. It happens, sometimes you get isekai’d to the wrong place. But then it happens AGAIN! Someone ELSE summons me, I get ANOTHER superpower, and then I’m somewhere totally new. Repeat ad nauseam. All right, goddess, where to next? And lemme just say this—the next time I get summoned better be my last, because I am so over this!</p>\r\n<p>[From <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://j-novel.club/series/oversummoned-overpowered-and-over-it#volume-1\" target=\"_blank\">J-Novel Club</a>]</p>",

But Yumiella wasn’t always Yumiella, you see. In her past life, she was nothing more than an introverted college student and devout gamer. So when she realizes that she’s been reincarnated as a hidden boss, she’s determined to steer clear of the protagonists and avoid her demise at their hands. All she wants is a nice, quiet life. Too bad when her gamer instincts kick in, Yumiella can’t just ignore her awesome stats... A girl’s gotta grind! So, with plenty of time on her hands before starting life at the academy, she gets a little carried away and maxes out her level at 99. And when everyone else finds out, they get the wrong idea about her power—now they think she’s the Demon Lord! Is this OP villainess strong enough to win back the peaceful life she always wanted?!</p>\r\n<p>[From <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://j-novel.club/series/villainess-level-99#volume-1\" target=\"_blank\">J-Novel Club</a>]</p>",

His self-indulgent fantasies and over the top antics make him a constant pain in the neck for his friends in the literary club...until, that is, they all suddenly awaken to spectacular supernatural powers! Their godlike abilities include stopping time, manipulating the elements, creating matter from nothing, subverting the very laws of reality, and...producing black fire that doesn’t burn. (Some superpowers are more godlike than others.) Andou's read enough comics to know what comes next: it’s only a matter of time before they'll be dragged into life-or-death battles with the fate of the world itself at stake! The world, however, disagrees. There are no villains, no battles, no earth-shattering disasters—nothing whatsoever. Half a year later, the literary club finds themselves confronting a new question: what do you do with supernatural powers when your day to day life is as commonplace as ever?</p>\r\n<p>[From <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://j-novel.club/series/when-supernatural-battles-became-commonplace#volume-1\" target=\"_blank\">J-Novel Club</a>]</p>",
